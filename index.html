<h2>This is a map of where I live in Chantilly, Virginia</h2>    
<p>I have been doing WhiteHat Jr since June of 2020. I really like it and I have learnt a lot of new things. Coding is something I was very eager to learn because I know in the future most jobs are going to be related and primarly focused on technology and knowing coding might help me get into a good college and eventually get a good job. Lots of people that have become very successful in life have become successful because of coding. For example Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and many more. My goal is to make my own app or brand and sell it out and become the CEO of that comapny that I make and I know that learning coding from WhiteHat Jr will help me with that. I encourage everyone to try coding at least once in their life and if you don't know where to start try a free trial at WhiteHat Jr!</p>

<h3>These are some other projects I have made with Whitehat Jr</h3>
    <span><iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/pZ_YLCk_MvguC2MjXqlqU3ohsAsb9KO9qq2RN6FCLdo/embed"></iframe><iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/sarUvztHjFjXk2BTty7iUyOvW3TpqXMI1PrCQjp45Hw/embed"></iframe><iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/8HJvnrYoUwwQNl-bX0joStgOdAU9bJWgbqFxKuDYTv0/embed"></iframe><iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/imPkEtIlW3r2JUkPgt_U7lbwUuRE3h0YeZBb6D6rnqk/embed"></iframe></span>
    <p>The project on the top left is a dice roll app. If you don'tn have a dice at home just use this online one. When you click roll the app will roll both dices randomly and it will automatically add up the dices for you.
        The app on the top right is a song app. Right now I have only added 3 songs but I will keep adding more. You can start by cliking the play button and when you want to change the song click the next button and then click the play button. Hope you enjoy!
        The app on the bottom left is a geometric calculator where you can put in the length of the shape and the app will give you the area or perimiter of the shape. This is a good app for school!
        Last of all the app on the bottom right is a art app. You can pick whatever shape you want from the dropdown menu, then you can choose the size , and then you use the arrows to move the pointer on where you want the shape to be, and after that you can click the check button and the app will insert your shape. You can make all kinds of things with this app!</p>
        <h4>These apps are only a fraction of apps I've made with WhitehatJr. I have learned so much and I have made so many awesome things. You should definitely try WhitehatJr if you want to do things like this!</h4>
    <h3>This is another thing I have made with with WhitehatJr. It's a small webpage about me.</h3>

<p> I also love to travel! I went on my first plane when I was 5 months old and I have been traveling ever since. I have been to about 30 countries and 5 continents. I've been to Australia, North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. Due to Covid-19 me and my family have not been able to travel that much but when Covid is over we are sure to go vist some nice place for a vacation.</p>
